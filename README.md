> *Bridging the gap between Classical Heritage and Modern Voices.*

**Füreya** is a comprehensive literary platform designed to encompass the entire spectrum of Turkish poetry—from the deep roots of **Divan Literature** to **Modern Republican Poetry**.

### 🛠 Technical Highlights

This project demonstrates full-stack mobile engineering capabilities, handling both static historical data and dynamic user-generated content.

#### 1. Content Management & Social Features
* **User Generated Content (UGC):** Implemented a robust "Creative Studio" allowing users to compose, format, and publish their own poems (*User Publishing System*).
* **Dynamic Feed:** The app serves content from distinct epochs (Classical, Folk, Modern) alongside a real-time stream of community poems.

#### 2. Advanced UI/UX Implementation
* **Custom Render Objects:** Handled complex typography and text rendering to respect the aesthetic integrity of poetry, regardless of the era.
* **Responsive Layouts:** Utilized `SliverGrid` and custom delegates for the category listing (*Grid View*), ensuring smooth scrolling performance even with heavy assets.

#### 3. Hardware Integration
* **Sensor Fusion:** The "Poetry Compass" (*Pusula Feature*) integrates device accelerometer and magnetometer sensors to create an interactive navigation experience, guiding users metaphorically through literary history.

#### 4. Backend & Data Architecture
* **Firebase Cloud Firestore:** Designed a scalable NoSQL schema to efficiently query both indexed historical archives and real-time user posts.
* **Authentication:** Managed secure user sessions to handle profile personalization and publishing rights.
